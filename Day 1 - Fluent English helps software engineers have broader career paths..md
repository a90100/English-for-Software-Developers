# Day 1 - Fluent English helps software engineers have broader career paths.

First things first, I have a question for you.
As a software engineer, what do you think are the most important factors that determine your salary? Skills? Personal abilities? Educational background? The country you work in? The company you work for? The industry you work in?

Of course, the factors I mentioned are all important. But if I had to choose the two most important ones, I would choose "the country you work in" and "the company you work for".

If you are a software engineer and work in a country with a higher income level than Taiwan, you have quite a high probability of getting a better salary than in Taiwan. Of course, expenses and taxes might be higher in these higher-income countries, but you also have the chance to save more money.
As a result, before you work in the country where you want to work, you should take these factors into account. If you find a country where you can save more money, control your expenses properly, have a stable income, and make reasonable investments, you can accelerate your wealth accumulation and implement geographic arbitrage.

What kind of companies can provide higher salaries for their employees?
Of course, they must have stable income and keep growing. Ideally, they make money from all over the world or play an important role in a particular industry.
In Taiwan, the companies that can offer higher salaries to software engineers include international businesses, TSMC, and MediaTek (MTK), as well as other companies in the semiconductor industry.

Unless the country you choose or the company you work for does not primarily use English, having fluent spoken English is essential for working abroad or in an international business environment. You can submit your resume to jobs that require fluent English to get more opportunities to stand on the world stage. Furthermore, working with foreign colleagues and reading the latest official documents on any technical skills also require English proficiency.

That's why fluent English helps software engineers have broader career paths. In this series of articles, I'll introduce useful business English phrases, sentences, and vocabulary related to software engineers. My goal is to help readers improve their English skills in the workplace. Let's learn English together!
