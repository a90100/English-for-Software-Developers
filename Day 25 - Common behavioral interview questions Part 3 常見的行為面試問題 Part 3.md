# Day 25 - Common behavioral interview questions Part 3 / 常見的行為面試問題 Part 3

In this article, I share some common behavioral interview questions and some questions you can ask interviewers for software engineers.

**The best way to use this article is to try answering these questions in English.**

## What growth have you achieved from working on these projects?

做過這些專案的成長是什麼?

### Example answer:

I think my skills and communication ability have grown significantly through these projects.

From a technical perspective, I have become more familiar with the React ecosystem. Before adopting a new technology, I now compare similar tools and evaluate why the new technology is needed, which is something I didn’t consider before. My problem-solving ability has also improved, and I am now better at considering edge cases.

From a collaboration perspective, my communication skills have improved by working with colleagues in different roles, such as backend engineers, QA engineers, and UI designers. I also realized that being a successful engineer is not just about writing great code — good communication is equally important.

## Tell me about a time you met a tight deadline.

告訴我一次你在緊迫的期限內完成任務的經歷。

### Example answer:

In my current job, I usually have enough time to develop features because our team only sets seasonal milestones and doesn’t impose many strict deadlines. However, if I face a tight timeline, I first try to push for more development time. If we still don’t have enough, we clarify the priorities of the features or simplify some of them. For example, if there is a complex animation on an activity webpage, we can replace it with a stunning image and focus on delivering the core features first. The **last resort** is to work overtime, but this approach should not be used often because it can hurt the team in the long run.

> last resort 最後的手段、最後的依據

## Tell me about a situation or experience you went through that changed your way of thinking.

告訴我你改變你思考方式的情況或經驗。

### Example answer:

Previously, when I left home around 8:30, I often encountered traffic chaos on the way to the office. I would see quite a few vehicles breaking the rules or rushing, which affected my mood.

Later, I changed my perspective and thought that if I left earlier, there would be fewer people on the road, and I would see less of this situation. So I started leaving around 8:00, and indeed, the traffic was much lighter, crossing the street was safer, and I saw far fewer rule-breaking vehicles.

## Questions to ask the interviewer / 詢問面試官的問題

請問你們的開發流程是什麼？假如有個功能需求被提出，那從提出這個功能到將它部署到正式環境的整個過程通常會經歷哪些步驟？

> 這題就可以問出很多東西了

* 主管怎麼分配該功能給誰比較適合
