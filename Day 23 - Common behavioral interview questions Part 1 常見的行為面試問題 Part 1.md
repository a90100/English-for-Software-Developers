### Example answer:

In one of my recent projects, I worked with a newly joined designer who was responsible for the design mockups, while I was the front-end engineer in charge of development. Since she was new to the team, we needed some time to adapt to each other’s working style.

The first challenge was that in our previous projects, our team had customized UI components and themes (such as fonts and color schemes) based on Material UI. These components could usually be reused across different projects. However, in this new project, the designer’s mockups had a completely different style, which meant our pre-built components and themes could not be reused directly. I discussed with my manager whether we should strictly follow the mockups. The benefit of doing so was that the product would look exactly like what the client had approved, but the downside was the extra development time. In the end, we **coordinated with** the client, and since they cared more about functionality than visuals, we decided to reuse our existing components and styles instead of fully redesigning everything.

The second challenge came after the mockups were finalized. I noticed that the designer mainly focused on the happy path and didn’t **account for** edge cases. For example, what if a bar chart contained a very large number of data points? For long data lists, should we use scrolling or pagination? For forms with many input fields, what are the validation rules? These were not clearly defined in the mockups. To address this, I reviewed the design in detail, listed potential issues, and helped her **clarify them with** the client.

The last challenge was adapting to a new design tool. Our company **switched from** Adobe XD **to** Figma because of a company policy. At that time, I **wasn’t aware of** the Dev Mode feature, so I had to develop using Design Mode, which slowed down my workflow. I communicated this with my manager, and he understood the situation and allowed me more time to complete the development.

From this experience, I learned the importance of clear communication, especially when working with new teammates who may bring habits from their previous jobs. It’s important to ask questions, **clarify uncertainties**, and also support new colleagues so that they can **integrate into** the team more smoothly.

> coordinate with 與...協調、配合
> account for 解釋（說明）、對...負責、佔據（數量或比例上）
> clarify with someone 向某人釐清、說明或進一步了解某事
> switch from... to... 表示從某個狀態/物轉換到另一個狀態/物
> be aware of 意識到、察覺到
> uncertainty 不確定性、不確定（或未知）的事物
> integrate into 將...融入、使...成為一體、結合

## How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within a team?

你如何處理團隊內部的衝突或分歧？

### Example answer:

When conflicts or disagreements happen within the team, I always listen to others’ perspectives to make sure everyone feels heard. Then, I remain neutral and try to identify both the **common ground** and the differences between colleagues’ thoughts. After I take a deep dive to understand the situation, I propose potential solutions or compromises and encourage open discussion. If we can’t reach an agreement, it’s time to escalate the issue to our team lead. When solving this kind of problem, maintaining respect and clear communication is the key to handling conflicts effectively.

> take sides 選擇某一方或偏袒某一方
> deep dive (n) 深入地探討或仔細地研究
> focus on shared goals 專注於共同目標
> common ground 共同點

## What are your strengths and weaknesses?

你的優點與弱點為何？

### Example answer:

My strengths are that I always **keep an open mind** to explore new technologies and be open to others’ perspectives. If our projects require a deep dive into a new technology, I am willing to investigate it and share my knowledge with my teammates. In discussions, I share my thoughts when appropriate, but I also respect and follow my team lead’s instructions.

My weakness is that I am more sensitive to noise and smells than most people. For example, if there is noise around my working environment, it becomes hard for me to focus. Also, my nose gets irritated when I smell burning incense or paper offerings. I am aware that my colleagues don’t react as strongly as I do, so I think I am more sensitive than average.

To overcome this, I wear both earplugs and over-ear headphones to **block out** noise so I can stay focused. There were also several times when the smell of burning offerings entered our office. In those situations, I moved to our laboratory, which did not have the smell, so I could continue my work without being affected.

## What Are Your Career Goals?

你的職涯目標是什麼？
